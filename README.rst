Introduction
============

Small package to manage configurations of classes, managing them via XML files.
The classes and functions allow to:

- Read and save configurations in XML format.
- Save a class constructor together with the arguments used to build it through the :class:`confmgr.Config` class.
- The configuration of the saved classes is then used to rebuild the same classes from the configuration file.
- Some functions also allow to manage files with duplicated configuration.

Find the full documentation for the package in the `GitHub Pages <https://mramospe.github.io/confmgr/>`_.
